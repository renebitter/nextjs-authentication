# NEXT.JS AUTHENTICATION USING NEXT-AUTH

Project built using `next-auth` library to handle authentication.

### Next-auth:

- `SessionProvider`
  Contains the 'session context' and is exposed at the top level of the application `_app.js`.
  `<SessionProvider session={pageProps.session}>` This will skip the 'session http request' on `profile.js` since it's provided by `getServerSideProps(context)` on `profile.js`.
  `auth.js` will send this 'session http request' since it does not have a `getServerSideProps(context)`.

- `useSession()`
  Frontend - Add React Hook. Checks if someone is signed in. Used in `main-navigation.js` component.

- `getSession()`
  Backend - Used to protect the API Route.

- `CredentialsProvider`
  Manages token creation behind the scenes, `JWT` (JSON Web Token), used in `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`.
  Needs to be a 'catch all route' because `next-auth` exposes multiple routes for login, logout and others more.

#### Next:

- `getServerSideProps()` fetches data from server on each request. Needed for `profile.js` page, since it needs to verify if the user is authorized. It also redirects the user from `profile.js` to `auth.js` if the user is not authorized, thus keeping `profile.js` only visible to authorized users.

- `useRouter()` for redirects. (e.g.: after login/logout `router.replace('/')`).

#### React:

- `useRef()` for capturing input in forms (e.g.: e-mail, password, etc.)

- `useState()` for setting and using state (e.g.: loading, error messages, request status like 'pending/success/error')

- `useEffect()` for setting timeout (e.g.: notification); check for session/authentication `auth.js`

#### Others:

- `bcryptjs` used for hashing and comparing passwords.

- `MongoClient` for database connection.

#### HTTP requests sent using `fetch`:

- `POST` to send login data.

- `PATCH` to change password.

#### Observations/Improvements:

- `getStaticProps()` could be implemented for additional content like a list of products and `getStaticPaths()` for accounting for dynamic pages with e.g. PDP (product detail pages). This would be outside of the scope of this `next-auth` project though.

#### Misc:

Setting an `<input />` `type` from `"password"` to `"text"` shows the typed in password.

##### `getServerSideProps()` `redirect`

Only redirects after reloading the page or explicitly typing the URL. Thus the need to define the redirect in the component to redirect it automatically after login.

`getServerSideProps()` example! on `auth.js` page, in an attempt to redirect to `profile.js` page after logging in. Doesn't work.

```bash
if (session) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/profile',
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }
```

`auth-form` component does the job.

```bash
      if (!result.error) {
        setRequestStatus('success');
        router.replace('/profile');
      }
```
